## Project Requirements

- User is required to log in to your application before they can use it. The user should be presented the choice to log in using either Google or by entering a username and password for your app directly

- Each users’ to-do list should be saved to a database. When a user logs in they should only be able to see and modify their own to-do list. The user’s to-do list should be preserved between sessions.

- Create an admin user for your application. When the admin user logs in they should be able to see a list of all the users registered with your app and the to-do lists for each user.
